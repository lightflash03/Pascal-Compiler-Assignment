Structure of Submission:

We have, in our submission, 3 folders: 
1. TASK3
2. TASK4
3. TASK5

And one file: 

ex.py

These folders contain all the relevant codes our team wrote for fulfilling the requirements of Assignment-2 Part-B. 
There is one file in this folder, named 'ex.py', which runs a shell script in each of the folders, giving the desired output of each of the tasks. 

Put your file list with relative path in 'ex.py' in the list variable: "textfile". This automates the running process for all programs pertaining to each task.

Run ex.py in a python environment that has the NLTK library installed.
